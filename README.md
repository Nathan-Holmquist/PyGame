# PyGame Game

## Pygame?
[Pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) is a python library that acts as a 2d game engine. It gives you all the tools to render things and place them on the screen and you do the rest. 
During this project I learned a lot about how to use Object Orented Programing and a bit of UI development. 
I eventually want to make a game in unity and learning about basic game engines is good practice. 

## How to play?
Clone the repository and just hit run on the python file, the game should run easy as that. 


## What is the high score of your game? 
I need to change the game logic because it doesn't increase in dificulty the way I want it to but the current top placements are

1. Francis - 107

2. Me - 104

If you end up getting a better score than this, message me, and I will place your name on the leaderboard, just send a ss of your high score

## Have Fun!

edit: The codebase is kind of bad, this wasn't planned out ahead of time so I kind of went with the flow of things. I understand it, but I don't know if someone reading it would. Sorry in advance and realize that this was just made for educational purposes.
